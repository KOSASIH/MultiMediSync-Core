# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

MultiMediSync-Core is designed to provide a scalable and secure platform for real-time patient data integration and synchronization across diverse healthcare systems. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, highlighting key components and their interactions.

## System Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

* Responsible for collecting patient data from various sources, including EHRs, laboratory systems, and wearable devices.
* Utilizes APIs and data connectors to aggregate data in real-time.

### 2. Data Processing Layer

* Handles data processing, transformation, and normalization.
* Employs machine learning algorithms for data analytics and insights.

### 3. Data Storage Layer

* Stores processed patient data in a secure and scalable database.
* Supports data retrieval and querying for authorized healthcare providers.

### 4. API Gateway

* Acts as the entry point for API requests from healthcare providers.
* Routes requests to appropriate services and handles responses.

### 5. Services Layer

* Provides business logic for data integration, analytics, and notifications.
* Utilizes middleware for authentication, error handling, and logging.

## System Interactions

### Data Flow

1. Patient data is collected from various sources through the Data Ingestion Layer.
2. Data is processed and transformed in the Data Processing Layer.
3. Processed data is stored in the Data Storage Layer.
4. Authorized healthcare providers access patient data through the API Gateway.
5. API requests are routed to the Services Layer for processing.

### API Interactions

* Healthcare providers send API requests to the API Gateway.
* API Gateway routes requests to the Services Layer.
* Services Layer processes requests and returns responses to the API Gateway.
* API Gateway returns responses to the healthcare providers.

## Conclusion

The MultiMediSync-Core system architecture is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and efficient platform for real-time patient data integration and synchronization. By understanding the system components and interactions, developers can effectively contribute to the project and ensure its continued growth and success.
